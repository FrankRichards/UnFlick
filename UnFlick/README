A Flickr backup utility designed to
 handle large photostreams. I have been
  unable to locate one that reliably works with my 
  wife's 15,000 and counting images.
  
  As long as I'm going to this much trouble
  I'm storing both the images and the
   metadata in a MySQL (actually MariaDB)
   database. 
   
After investing too much time, it seems that both of the
 actually capable Python wrappers for the Flickr API are
 seriously Python 2. DTFlickr looks possuble, but blows
 up on a anomaly in flickr.reflction. Python-flickrapi is,
  despite its blurb, really really old.
  
  Wheel, stand by to get reinvented. Actually not. I need 4
  to 6 methods to do everything I want to do. If Flickr
  changes the arguments, I can introspect till the cows come
  home and it won't help.
  
  Urllib is not that hard.
