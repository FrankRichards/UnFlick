A Flickr backup utility designed to
 handle large photostreams. I have been
  unable to locate one that reliably works with my 
  wife's 15,000 and counting images.
  
  As long as I'm going to this much trouble
  I'm storing both the images and the
   metadata in a MySQL (actually MariaDB)
   database.
